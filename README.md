# TestingMySQLApp
The most basic example of a console app to test connectivity to MySql server

This is created in Visual Studio 2019, .NET Framework 4.8, and Nuget Package MySql.Data 8.0.23 from Oracle

The program only create a table, insert 2 records and execute a select of the table.

This is only to validate if we can connect to an existing MySQL Instance and execute something.
