# TestingMySQLApp
The most basic example of a console app to test connectivity to MySql server

This is created in Visual Studio 2019, .NET Framework 4.8, and Nuget Package MySql.Data 8.0.23 from Oracle

The program only create a table, insert 2 records and execute a select of the table.

This is only to validate if we can connect to an existing MySQL Instance and execute something.

To run the program, you need to have installed and running MySQL Server on your computer, default port 3306 is used, and you need to create a database named dbtest and a user "test" with password "test"
